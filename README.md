# The-Robin-3D-Printer-Project

The Robin 3D printers share the goal to be simple to build, based on a simple and
repeatable principle, and consist of parts that can be produced with smaller 3D printers.

### Robin
A simple to build 3D printer with a combined X/Y stage.
This printer can be used with very high accuracy as well as with very heavy print head assemblies,
because the print head does not move except in the Z-direction.

### Robin Plus
The Rob Plus 3D printer is build with an inverted-H-assembly, not unlike a coreXY setup, but
all steppers are connected along a single line, giving the printer a sleek but sturdy frame.
Hence the name Robin Plus - the timing belt forms the plus shape.
The Z-Axis can be built with either a single or a double-sided crane. The double-sided setup
is much less prone to vibrations, while the single-sided setup is very simple and good to
use as an educational example.

### Bad Robin
Bad Robin is the smaller brother of the Big Bad Robin 3D printer. Both printers share the same
parts, only the aluminium profiles and the linear rails change in size - all other parts stay the same.
Bad Robin has a very low parts count, a high resolution and can go very fast. It is also very affordable
with the 250mm rails version costing around 250 Euros in non-printed parts.
